 Our project aims to streamline the process of managing inventory within a warehouse setting. We've implemented a system with three distinct login roles to ensure proper access control and security.

**Admin**: This role has the highest level of access and is responsible for overall management of the system. Admins can add or remove users, manage inventory, generate reports, and adjust system settings.

**User**: Users have restricted access compared to admins. They can view inventory, place orders, and track their orders, but they don't have the authority to modify inventory levels or system configurations.

**Employee**: Employees have the most limited access and are primarily responsible for day-to-day operations within the warehouse. They can view inventory levels, update stock quantities based on shipments or sales, and fulfill orders.
We used PHP for server-side scripting to handle user authentication, data processing, and database interactions. 

 Security was a top priority in our project. We implemented measures such as password hashing to securely store user credentials, session management to control user access throughout their session
